# configs

This repository stores my personal configuration files for tools like Zsh, Kitty, Neovim and others.
Its main purpose is to serve as a backup and quick restore point in case of system reinstallations or major changes.  
Having all configs in one place allows me to easily set up a familiar environment on any machine.
